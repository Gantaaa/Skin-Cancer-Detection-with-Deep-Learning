## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores the use of deep learning for **automated skin cancer detection**. Using the HAM10000 dataset, I built and trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify different types of skin lesions. The goal is to demonstrate how AI can support early diagnosis and improve healthcare accessibility.

## 🚀 Key Features
- Preprocessing and augmentation of medical image data  
- Custom CNN architecture for image classification  
- Evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, and visualizations  
- Achieved **80% accuracy** on test set  

## 📂 Repository Structure
├── FinalDeliverable.ipynb # Main Colab notebook

├── README.md # Project documentation

└── requirements.txt # Python dependencies

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python, NumPy, Pandas
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Google Colab

## 📊 Results
- Training accuracy: 80%  
- Validation accuracy: 80%  

## 📈 Future Improvements
- Experiment with pre-trained models (ResNet, EfficientNet)  
- Deploy as a web app for easy usage  
- Improve dataset balance with augmentation techniques  

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open the notebook directly in Google Colab:
