# Skin Cancer Detection with Deep Learning

[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)]([https://colab.research.google.com/github/yourusername/skin-cancer-detection/blob/main/skin-cancer-detection.ipynb](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1nML3W149VCJofEhqm7GDYb7KgoB4HYEL?authuser=2#scrollTo=8e1gyNlvSUxz)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project explores the use of deep learning for **automated skin cancer detection**. Using the HAM10000 dataset, I built and trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify different types of skin lesions. The goal is to demonstrate how AI can support early diagnosis and improve healthcare accessibility.

## ðŸš€ Key Features
- Preprocessing and augmentation of medical image data  
- Custom CNN architecture for image classification  
- Evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, and visualizations  
- Achieved **80% accuracy** on test set
