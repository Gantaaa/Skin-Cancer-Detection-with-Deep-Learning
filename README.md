## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project explores the use of deep learning for **automated skin cancer detection**. Using the HAM10000 dataset, I built and trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify different types of skin lesions. The goal is to demonstrate how AI can support early diagnosis and improve healthcare accessibility.

## ðŸš€ Key Features
- Preprocessing and augmentation of medical image data  
- Custom CNN architecture for image classification  
- Evaluation with accuracy, confusion matrix, and visualizations  
- Achieved **80% accuracy** on test set
